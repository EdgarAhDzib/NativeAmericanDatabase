<h3>1  Introduction</h3>
<p>
The settlement of the Alderville reserve in Alnwick
Township will be examined with the Methodist church
assuming authority over the reserve until the 1876
Indian Act took legislative control of First Nations lives.
When the reserves were first formed, First Nations were
encouraged to become either farmers or trades-persons,
roles that were traditionally reserved for the lower class.
The Methodist church was there as community founder.
Their intentions were good. Houses and barns were their
first priorities to ensure a rural form of life,
as opposed to a traditional First Nations life style.
Hunting, fishing and gathering were side issues
and not valued as economic venues for serious income to
sustain the community.
</p>
<p>
The Indian agents strictly governed their charges with the
supreme authority of English law formed by acts of law and
the federal judicial system. The hunting, fishing and
gathering activities were to be discouraged as this would
keep their charges from the serious work of social
dependence and servitude to the larger Canadian society.
They were there to only provide food and other
trades-person activities. The first inhabitants of
Alderville were strongly encouraged to act like Europeans,
but only in subservient roles. The Mississauga
First Nations peoples in the Bay of Quinte were removed
from their homes to allow for expansion of the native
farms in their new lands. If ever an individual exceeded
his role, he lost his official Indian status and had to
leave the reserve. It could be argued that on-reserve
First Nations are still living under the strict conditions
of the Indian Act of 1876.
</p>
<p>
A more personal view from the inside of the reserve system
will be recalled showing a lack of cultural progress
through the first century of reserve life. I was a
subjective observer growing up on the
Alderville First Nation in southern Ontario with no
conception of the invisible boundaries surrounding reserve
life. It was a very happy childhood and adolescence.
My grandfather gave his time, imparting his very extensive
knowledge of the details of farming. To him the grass that
grows, even the trees were concrete examples of how to
enrich our lives. My grandmother, although an integral
part of reserve life, took it upon herself to research and
document our personal history and migration to Alderville.
My father showed me all aspects of his culture, including
trapping, hunting, and rice gathering but was disappointed
that I showed no talent as a carpenter. My mother
ceaselessly raised a decent family. Her First Nations
crafts as well as her char duties were done with pride.

</div>
<div id="two">
<h3>2  The Settling of the Alderville Reserve</h3>
<p>
The Alderville Reserve was settled in 1837 by a band of
the Ojibwa. This band was acknowledged to exist a decade
later by the Ojibway chief G. Copway in 1850 in his
history.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
These Indians became converts to Christianity in the years
1826-1827. Previous to those years, they were pagans,
wandering in the neighbourhood of Belleville, Kingston,
Gananoque, and were known by the name of 'the Mississagas
of the Bay of Quinte.' In the years referred to, two or
three hundred were received into the Wesleyan Methodist
church, and settled on Grape Island, in the Bay of Quinte,
six miles from Belville. (Copway 1850: 186-187).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
They had remained there, essentially unchanged as little
as fifty years ago. Significant yet subtle changes were
experienced over this period. By 1960, wooden tools were
replaced by steel tools, along with modern milk separators.
Technology moved on, but the mindset of farming and trades
continued. Preachers came and went, giving their view of
reality. The Indian Act still kept them separated from the
society at large. There was no vote, no land ownership
off the reserve. The band members were in a transparent
bubble, not of their own making, yet they prospered in
their own eyes and lived good full lives.
</p>
<p>
When these Indians of Grape Island left the Bay of Quinte
area they traveled over land with their cattle, the few
possessions that they could carry on their way to Alnwick
township. An industrial school was one of the first
buildings on the reserve, opened to teach occupations.
Parts of their history were recorded by Mary Jane Simpson
who worked tirelessly to reveal the history of her
ancestors to the world outside the reserve. She once
hitchhiked along highway 7 to Ottawa in order to find
reference materials for her research. On her deathbed she
passed on the opportunity to ensure that her history would
eventually be known. It was later published online in 2000
by her grandson, Alfred Simpson, who created the web-site
www.ricelakereserves.com to ensure that everyone could
learn the story. Browsers from China have read her
Rice Lake history. Mary Jane Simpson wrote:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
they removed to a block of Crown Lands granted them by the
Lieut-Governor, Sir John Colborne, in the Township of
Alnwick not far from Rice Lake, fifteen miles north-east
from Cobourg. This plot, which contains 2,000 acres, is
divided into Lots of 25 acres each. The village or street,
which is called Alderville, is about a mile and a half in
length. It contains 36 houses, 6 barns, a school-house,
in which divine worship is performed, all erected under
direction of the Indian Dep't (Simpson 1953:15)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
She wrote further.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
These Indians are 233 in number; each family has at least
half its lots cleared, and several have nearly the whole
under cultivation. The total quantity cleared is between
360 and 400 acres. The stock belonging to these Indians
consists of 8 yoke of oxen, 2 horses, 11 cows, 21 heifers
and calves, a quantity of pigs and poultry. They possess
8 ploughs, 6 harrows, 3 carts and wagons, and 12 ox-sleds.
Their progress in industry and agriculture is satisfactory.
(Simpson 1953:15)
</p></blockquote>
<a href="#Top"> </a><a name="Agents"></a>
</div>
<div id="three">
<h3>3  The Indian Agents</h3>
<p>
The Indian Act of 1867 codified the rights and
responsibilities of the Indian Agents. "The term ‘agent’
means a commissioner, superintendent, agent, or other
officer acting under the instructions of the
Superintendent-General." (Indian Act 1876:3.11) One agent
was given authority over several reserves and had
authority over the First Nation population and had
specific orders regarding how the Indians should behave.
These agents were given absolute powers over their
'charges'. They were treated like 'wards of the state'
because that was exactly what they were. Certain head men
were chosen among the First Nations and were allowed to
help maintain order within the reserve.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In order to be a leader, an Indian was supposed to promote
earning a living by farming and raising cattle and not
behave at all like an Indian. Band members were not to
take part in anything that encouraged them to waste time
or kept them from their serious work. The government
wanted Indians to live like Europeans, always working.
(Lerat-Ungar 2005:112)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The National Interest was a belief used by the Canadian
federal government to control the indigenous populations.
This was a rationale that filtered down to all
Indian Agents to adhere to, in the pursuit of their duty.
The Indian agents treated their charges like children,
giving 'gifts' on a haphazard basis. One year in
Alderville the Indian Agent personally delivered a box of
Kam to each household. He also once brought different
sizes of red plastic balls for the Indian Day School.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
When the 'national interest' imperative required that
Indians should be removed from their ancestral lands to
make way for settlers and business enterprise, the image
of Indians was transmuted from heathen into a childlike
people, ignorant, naive, and vulnerable to exploitation,
debauching by alcohol, and abuse by unprincipled European
traffickers. Such a people needed government protection,
and thus the reserve system was introduced, along with the
Indian Act. (Boldt 1993:69)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Did the federal government have the right to assume such
powers over the First Nations of Canada? Regardless, that
is the right that they assumed was theirs. The settlers in
Canada were united under one purpose, one government for
all. The First Nations had no such united front.
Benjamin Franklin was purported to say, that "If we don't
hang together then surely, we will hang separately".
The settlers were used to passing acts, whereas the
indigenous peoples relied on an oral history that held
little force under the system of rules imposed by
a distant, yet ever present federal authority.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 1864, the descendants of the people who arrived here
five hundred years ago took it upon themselves to forge a
constitution without us. It became the
British North America Act of 1867. In this Act, the federal
government gave itself the power over Indians and lands
reserved for the Indians. It did not ask us if we agreed;
it just assumed power over our peoples. We were not even
there when the decision was made. We must ask ourselves,
by what right did they get that power and how have the used
it? These questions are critical to our future
relationships with this nation. (Mercredi and Turpel 1993: 23).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Indian nations were therefore denied rights that were
guaranteed to the non-Indian residents of Canada. Those
who could not live under such conditions on the reserve
had to leave. They became officially non-Indians, with
full Canadian rights but no longer First Nations.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Any Indian who may be admitted to the degree of Doctor of
Medicine, or to any other degree by any University of
Learning, or who may be admitted in any Province of the
Dominion to practice law either as an Advocate or as a
Barrister or Counsellor or Solicitor or Attorney or to be
a Notary Public, or who may enter Holy Orders or who may
be licensed by any denomination of Christians as a
Minister of the Gospel, shall ipso facto become and be
enfranchised under this Act. (Indian Act 1876:86.1)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
When they returned to Alderville, they could stay with
their relatives but they had no official status within
the reserve. Many pined to become ‘Indian’ again, but were
denied such until the Indian Act was revised in the 1980s.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Indian nations were therefore denied those fundamental
rights that are taken for granted in any democratic system.
They were, as a matter of colonial and provincial policy,
denied rights to lands they had occupied for centuries.
This exclusion from the land was extended through the
discriminatory provisions of colonial and provincial land
legislation. And they were prohibited by federal law
seeking a legal remedy for this injustice.
(Jensen and Brooks 1991: 36)

<h3>4  A Personal View</h3>
<p>
The settlement of the Alderville reserve in
Alnwick Township will be examined with the Methodist church
assuming authority over the reserve until the 1876
Indian Act took control of First Nations lives. When the
reserves were first formed, First Nations were encouraged
to become either farmers or trades-persons, roles that
were traditionally reserved for the lower class. The
Alderville industrial school was replaced by an
Indian Day School on the grounds of the old industrial
school. The Methodist church was there as well. Their
intentions were good. Houses and barns were their first
priorities to ensure a rural form of life, as opposed to a
traditional First Nations life style. Hunting, fishing and
gathering were side issues and not valued as economic
venues for serious income to sustain the community.

They were there to only provide food and other maintenance
trades-person activities. These first inhabitants of

in the Bay of Quinte were removed from their homes to make
way for settlers and their commercial enterprises. If ever
an individual exceeded his role, he lost his official
Indian status and had to leave the reserve. It could be
argued that on-reserve First Nations are still living
under the strict conditions of the Indian Act of 1876.
</p>
<p>
A more personal view from the inside of the reserve system
will be recalled showing a lack of cultural progress
through the first century of reserve life. I was a
subjective observer growing up on the
Alderville First Nation in southern Ontario with no
conception of the invisible boundaries surrounding reserve

My grandfather gave his time, imparting his very extensive

My father showed me all aspects of his culture, including
trapping, hunting, and rice gathering but was disappointed
that I showed no talent as a carpenter. My mother
ceaselessly raised a decent family. Her First Nations
crafts as well as her char duties were done with pride.
</p>
<p>
There has been shown to be a lack of cultural progress
through the first one hundred years of life on the reserve.
I grew up on the Alderville First Nation in southern
Ontario with a view that life outside the reserve was a
foreign place. Traditional lore was passed down from my
grandfather. He became what the early church was hoping
the Indians of Alderville would become: i.e. farmers,
hunters and trades-persons. To water his crops, my
grandfather learned the art of water witching. He taught
me for effective water witching, to find underground
streams, he showed a forked branch and said that any
wooden dousing fork must come from a nut bearing tree.
He considered his front lawn a farm for dew worms. Well
into his eighties, he got up in the pre-dawn to pick dew
worms selling each at the bargain price of a penny a worm
to passing fisherman. My grandmother was involved in the
early formation of the First Nations woman’s
Homemakers Association. This included forming quilting bees
for use on the reserve. She taught Christian values at the
local Sunday school, a duty which she took seriously.
My Grandfather and Grandmother took on agricultural roles.
They grew and raised potatoes, strawberries, raspberries,
pigs, and chickens. They ate what they produced and sold
the excess for profit.
</p>
<p>
My father took me on a trip along his trapping line, and
showed me how to set up the traps. He would return from
a successful run in good spirits. The skinning was next,
followed by the drying of the pelt on wire frames.
We didn't forget the carcass which was baked and served
for supper. He hunted twice a year, always bringing back
a deer, which was skinned in the basement and later he
took the hide to the local tannery in Hastings Ontario.
The carcass was cut up in strips and venison was stored in
the freezer. As a carpenter, he was proud of his role as a
trades-man because he could provide more than adequately
for his family. My mother took on a job as a char-woman in
the local town. She also produced traditional
First Nations crafts, particularly small birch bark
containers decorated with porcupine quills, which added to
the family income. My father and mother harvested the
local rivers and streams. They regarded the gathering of
wild rice as farming. I went with my parents while they
canoed through thick fields of beds of wild rice. My dad
paddled through the rice beds as mom knocked the rice into
the bottom of the canoe. Once home, dad 'danced' the rice
in a large iron kettle and used the wind to separate the
rice from the chaff. This was a staple and well enjoyed
treat. "The wild rice that grows abundantly in eastern
Canada round the shores, of many lakes makes an excellent
food, but only the Ojibwa collected it and used it to
supplement their diet of berries, fish and meat."
(Jenness 1933: 16-17)
</p>
<p>
The Alderville church left the Methodist fold in 1925 to
join the newly formed United Church of Canada. The whole
community was involved with church activities. A favourite
was Mother's Day where a red flower was worn if your
mother was alive and a white flower if she had passed on.
Each family had their own wooden pew. It was very
comforting to attend worship services as well as both
weddings and funerals. It was a centre of community bonding.

                  DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS
CIRCULAR                   OTTAWA, Thursday, 15<sup>th</sup> December, 1921
</pre>
<p>
Sir,
</p>
<p>
It is observed with alarm that the holding of dances by
the Indians on their reserves is on the increase, and
that these practices tend to disorganize the efforts which
the Department is putting forth to make them
self-supporting.
<a name="photo"></a>

</div>
<p>
I have, therefore, to direct you to use your utmost
endeavours to dissuade the Indians from excessive
indulgence in the practice of dancing. You should suppress
any dances which cause waste of time, interfere with the
occupations of the Indians, unsettle them for serious work,
injure their health or encourage them in sloth and
idleness. You should also dissuade, and, if possible,
prevent them from leaving their reserves for the purpose
of attending fairs, exhibitions, etc., when their absence
would result in their own-farming and other interests
being neglected. It is realized that reasonable amusement
and recreation should be enjoyed by Indians, but they
should not be allowed to dissipate their energies and
abandon themselves to demoralizing amusements. By the use
of tact and firmness you can obtain control, keep it, and
this obstacle to continued progress will then disappear.
</p>
<p>
The rooms, halls or other places in which Indians
congregate should be under constant inspection.
They should be scrubbed, fumigated, cleansed or
disinfected to prevent the dissemination of disease. The
Indians should be instructed in regard to the matter of
proper ventilation and the avoidance of over-crowding
rooms where public assemblies are being held, and proper
arrangement should be made for the shelter of their horses
and ponies. The Agent will avail himself of the services
of the medical attendant of his agency in this connection.
</p>
<p>
Except where further information is desired, there will be
no necessity to acknowledge the receipt of this circular.
</p>
<pre>
 Thomas Graham, Esquire,       Yours very truly,
 Indian Agent,                 Duncan Campbell Scott,

<h3>6  Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The settlement of Alderville was accomplished in a benign
manner, certainly by the Church with the best of
intentions. The current church was built in 1870. The
residents of Alderville became either farmers or trades
people, and this was a role that made them happy.
The houses and barns that they started with are still
there in more modern forms.
</p>

The Indian agent came down from Peterborough to inspect
our activities and to give his approval. The overseeing
mentality was still strong as I grew up. In that isolation
I wished that I was a 'Canadian'. Handing out food and
pink rubber balls was a way to show our dependence on
Indian Affairs.

The First Nations of Alderville have emerged from the
farming culture that was imposed upon them. They are still
strongly into the trades and are proud of their handiwork.
The band council can determine their direction but with
funds coming from the government, they are still limited.

My grandfather and grandmother taught me what they learned
and passed it on to me. My father and mother included me
in their trapping, hunting, and rice gathering. In my
opinion life was good.
